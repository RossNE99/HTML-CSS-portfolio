# Ross Charlton - Web development portfolio 🚀

## Description
This repository showcases my web development portfolio, a testament to my skills in the dynamic field of web development. Crafted with a mission to highlight my expertise, it serves as a vital asset in today's competitive market. 

The main aim of this GitHub project is to be able to showcase the skills I've learnt whilst studying different technologies. This project uses HTML and CSS and will be updated along the way, to include new technologies I learn.

The problem I identified when starting this project was that I didn't have a portfolio, which means that I had no way of showing companies what I am capable of. This problem is now solved as I have a fully deployed portfolio which highlights my skills, past projects and how people can contact me.
